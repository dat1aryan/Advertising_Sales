# Advertising Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising expenditure across different media channels such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

## Dataset
- Source: Advertising dataset
- Features: TV, Radio, Newspaper
- Target: Sales

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Machine Learning Models
- Linear Regression
- XGBoost Regressor

## Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Outlier analysis using IQR
4. Train-test split
5. Model training
6. Model saving using pickle

## Results
The trained model learns the relationship between advertising budgets and sales and can be reused for future predictions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow on a regression problem.
